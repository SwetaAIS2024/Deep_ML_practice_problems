# Single Neuron implementation
# Write a Python function that simulates a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification, 
# handling multidimensional input features. The function should take a list of feature vectors (each vector representing 
# multiple features for an example), associated true binary labels, and the neuron's weights (one for each feature) and b
# ias as input. It should return the predicted probabilities after sigmoid activation and the mean squared error between 
# the predicted probabilities and the true labels, both rounded to four decimal places.
